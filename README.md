For the everyday student grinding through lectures, assignments, and group projects, who struggles with time management and seeks tangible proof of their dedication, LearnoDoro is the solution. It offers a customized study regiment enriched by insightful feedback. While numerous other timer apps exist, most offer just basic timer functionality and miss out on the analytics on how your time is spent. LearnoDoro ensures that students (and whoever finds good use of it) gain a comprehensive overview of precisely how their study hours are allocated.

## **What even is Pomodoro?**

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves working in focused 25-minute intervals (called "Pomodoros") followed by short breaks to improve productivity and concentration.

### **The Pomodoro Process**

1. Choose task to do
2. Set Pomodoro timer (usually 25 min)
3. Do the task until the timer reaches 0
4. take a short break (ca. 5â€“10 min)
5. Return to Step 2 and repeat until four pomodoros are completed
6. After four pomodoros, take a long break (ca. 20-30 min) instead of a short break
7. Return to step 2

## **Core Features**

1) Pomodoro Timer
   - Users select a "Course" at the start of each Pomodoro. Optionally, they may choose a specific "Task" within that course
   - Start/Stop the countdown timer
   - Settings to customize study time duration, short break length, long break length and the number of Pomodoros required before a long break

2) Courses
   - Create a "Course"
   - Create a "Task" within a "Course"
   - Time spent working on a specific "Course" is logged

3) Tasks
   - Create a "Task" in a "Course"
   - Time spent working on a specific "Task" is logged too

4) Logs and Analytics
   - Logs each "StudySession" spent on each "Course" and "Task"
   - Comparative Analysis across "Courses" and "Tasks"
   - View study time over selected time-periods
   - Visual Representations like bar graphs, pie charts and line charts for easy understanding
   - Export "StudySessions" to .csv for further analysis
